Reasoning Behind Collected Metadata:
	25 representative files from Perermenias Aristotelis were selected to collect metadata from. These files highlight the spine and 
cover of the book, as well as sequential pages from four segments of the book. These segments were chosen in order to provide samples of 
each of the unique pieces of writing found. For every file, the originally assigned page number is recorded to give an idea of where in the book
it is found. The material of the file was noted, as the 19th century leather utilized for the cover reveals that it had been rebound after a 
transfer in possession, and whether a page is paper or parchment indicates whether it is original to the book. The page composition and image 
descriptions provide the data necessary to differentiate between files and assist in dating them. The included colors also serve this purpose.
It was noted whether the files included unoriginal elements, such as additions to the margins or highlights, in order to facilitate the 
understanding of the context behind the content. Lastly, any damage to the pages was recorded, as this may reveal what conditions the book has been 
exposed to and how well it has been preserved.
