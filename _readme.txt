Reasoning Behind Collected Metadata:
	25 representative files from Perermenias Aristotelis were selected to collect metadata from. These files highlight the spine and 
cover of the book, as well as sequential pages from four segments of the book. These segments were chosen in order to provide samples of 
each of the unique pieces of writing found. For every file, the originally assigned page number is recorded to give an idea of where in the book
it is found. The material of the file was noted, as the 19th century leather utilized for the cover reveals that it had been rebound after a 
transfer in possession, and whether a page is paper or parchment indicates whether it is original to the book. The page composition and image 
descriptions provide the data necessary to differentiate between files and assist in dating them. The included colors also serve this purpose.
It was noted whether the files included unoriginal elements, such as additions to the margins or highlights, in order to facilitate the 
understanding of the context behind the content. Lastly, any damage to the pages was recorded, as this may reveal what conditions the book has been 
exposed to and how well it has been preserved.  

Notes on HTR Process:
	Put simply, utilizing Transkribus for Handwrittem Text Recognition transcription of Permiermenias Aristoteles was arduous and tedious. An AI model 
named "Carolingian Minuscule Model CMM 9th-11th c." was utilized for recognition of the text, however, its %CER (Accuracy) was only rated 5.20%, meaning that 
there were a significant number of errors on every page. This required labor-intensive corrections, which was made even more difficult by my inability to 
understand Latin and limited knowledge about how its alphabet and syntax differs from English. Further research was conducted in attempts to discern words
from the misspellings generated by the model and familiarize myself with unknown symbols. I also had to make decisions about how to treat elements that were
not straight text. The codex contains a lot of writing in the margins and between lines, which I resolved by treating marginal writing as seperate regions
and writing between lines as their own lines. Additionally, some of the diagrams and tables included vertical or diagonal text, which was not detected by the software.
I was not able to find a way to include this text in a logical way, although the horizontal text on tables was treated as their own lines. The illuminations of 
certain letters also interfered with bodies of writing, causing lines to appear on the transcriptions as two separate lines, and needing to be strung together 
manually in the txt file. There were segments of writing that were obstructed by highlights, damage, or too faded to read, which were not possible to transcribe.
In general, Transkribus was much more accurate for the writings from the 11th century when compared to the 9th century. It is highly likely that the text files 
still contain many mistakes, but much effort was put into producing the best possible transcriptions for each page.
